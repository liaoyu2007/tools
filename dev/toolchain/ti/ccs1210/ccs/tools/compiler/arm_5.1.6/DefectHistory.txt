FIXED SDSCM00049229
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary            : Symbols are missing in .debug_pubnames part of the Dwarf
                     information

Fixed in           : 5.1.6
Severity           : S1 - Critical / PS
Affected Component : C/C++ Compiler (cl)

Release Notes:
  This bug happens all the time. It causes the missing of .debug_pubnames
  section. If the users rely on the .debug_pubnames to search the global
  variable or function's debug information entry, he will see this bug and
  will have no .debug_pubnames sections.
  
  This bug should only affect debug capability. Not the execution results.

Workaround:
  There is no work around for this bug.

FIXED SDSCM00049326
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary            : RTTI is enabled by default with no way to disable it. 
                     For C++ code, this can cause data size to double.

Fixed in           : 5.1.6
Severity           : S2 - Major
Affected Component : C/C++ Compiler (cl)

Release Notes:
  Adding the -rtti option should now suppress variable type info

Workaround:
  None.

FIXED SDSCM00049421
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary            : Auto-generated stress test terminate abnormally in
                     optimizer

Fixed in           : 5.1.6
Severity           : S2 - Major
Affected Component : C/C++ Compiler (cl)

Release Notes:
  This test is a very large sequence of recurrent assignments. The
  compiler combines all of them into one very large statement, and crashes
  or aborts depending on the release and platform.
  
  The reported crash with release C6000 5.1.0 is a stack overflow that happens
  only on Windows. It is probably due to an inefficiency in the Windows
  C++ compiler that was used to build the release, but we can't reproduce
  the problem when we use our current Windows compiler. (C6000 5.1.0 was built
  in 2004.)
  
  The aborts seen in releases C6000 6.1.x through 7.x are due to an overly
  conservative sanity check, triggered by the very large statement.
  
  Defect occurs in TMS470 Compiler versions: 4.4.10.100 - 4.4.10.121,
  4.6.0B1 - 4.6.6, 4.4.15.201 - 4.4.15.210, 4.9.0B1 - 4.9.9, 5.0.0B1 -
  5.0.8, 5.1.0B1 - 5.1.5

Workaround:
  Compile at -o0; since the test case involves no loops or control flow,
  that's no less efficient than higher optimisation levels. Or reduce the
  size of the test case, as mentioned in the original report. Or use two
  or more accumulators, combined at the end, instead of one single
  accumulator; that reduces the maximum statement size.

Summary            : C Initialization records are created for NOLOAD sections

Fixed in           : 5.1.6
Severity           : S3 - Minor
Affected Component : ELF Linker

Release Notes:
  A NOLOAD output section is not allocated in the executable file created
  by the linker. If RAM model is used as the initialization method, the section
  will not be initialized by the loader since it is not allocated in memory. If
  ROM model is used it will be initialized because the linker creates
  initialization records in the .cinit section even if the section is marked
  NOLOAD This is a bug.
  
  Defect occurs in TMS470 Compiler versions: 4.4.10.100 - 4.4.10.121,
  4.6.0B1 - 4.6.6, 4.4.15.201 - 4.4.15.210, 4.9.0B1 - 4.9.9, 5.0.0B1 -
  5.0.8, 5.1.4 - 5.1.5

Workaround:
  Specify the type as NOINIT in addition to NOLOAD

Summary            : Compiler generates CBZ to a label that is too far away

Fixed in           : 5.1.6
Severity           : S2 - Major
Affected Component : Code Generator

Release Notes:
  On Cortex devices, the compiler may generate a CBZ instruction with a
  destination branch that is too far away. This bug can only appear
  when --unaligned_access=on, which is the default for Cortex devices.
  
  Defect occurs in TMS470 Compiler versions: 5.1.0B1 - 5.1.5

Workaround:
  Use the option --unaligned_access=off

Summary            : Missing copyright notice on mklib.c source

Fixed in           : 5.1.6
Severity           : S2 - Major
Affected Component : Runtime Support Libraries (RTS)

Release Notes:
  The source code for mklib (mklib.c) is part of the product but lacks a
  proper copyright statement. This file should have the same copyright
  as the other TI-generated source files in the RTS library source code.
  
  Defect occurs in TMS470 Compiler versions: 5.0.0B1 - 5.0.8, 5.1.0B1 - 5.1.5

Workaround:
  Not applicable

Summary            : SIGSEGV when using pragma on a template function

Fixed in           : 5.1.6
Severity           : S2 - Major
Affected Component : Parser

Release Notes:
  The compiler may emit an internal error (SIGSEGV) when the user attempts
  to apply a pragma to a template class function.
  
  Defect occurs in TMS470 Compiler versions: 2.54.02 - 2.54.209, 2.54.03 -
  2.54.129, 4.4.10.100 - 4.4.10.121, 4.6.0B1 - 4.6.6, 4.4.15.200 - 4.4.15.210,
  4.9.0B1 - 4.9.9, 5.0.0B1 - 5.0.8, 5.1.0B1 - 5.1.5

Workaround:
  Do not apply any pragma to a template function. Move the function
  outside the template class.

2. Defects fixed in TMS470 Code Generation Tools release 5.1.5
===============================================================================

The following 2 defects were fixed in TMS470 Code Generation Tools release
5.1.5, released February 2014.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIXED SDSCM00048498
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary            : MISRA-C rule 12.8 incorrectly reported for an expression
                     like ((uint32_t)2U << 8U);

Fixed in           : 5.1.5
Severity           : S2 - Major
Affected Component : Parser

Release Notes:
  A violation warning for the MISRA 12.8 rule was reported for the
  expression: ((uint32_t)2U << 8U);
  
  The MISRA 12.8 rule states that "The right-hand operand of a shift
  operator shall lie between zero and one less than the width in bits of
  the underlying type of the left-hand operand". The underlying type is
  determined by section 6.10 of the MISRA Guidelines. For a literal it is
  defined as being the smallest type of the same sign that can represent
  the literal, so for 2U the type is unsigned char. In that case the
  diagnostic is correct. However, the cast to uint32_t should make the
  underlying type unsigned int, making the operation legal.
  
  Defect occurs in TMS470 Compiler versions: 4.9.0B1 - 4.9.9, 5.0.0B1 - 5.0.8,
  5.1.0B1 - 5.1.4

Workaround:
  None.

Summary            : Use of .align directive with large value (>8K) may cause
                     internal assembler error

Fixed in           : 5.1.5
Severity           : S2 - Major
Affected Component : Assembler

Release Notes:
  This bug will occur when the assembler must generate 64K or more bits of
  fill to achieve the requested alignment for a symbol. One workaround is
  to place the symbol in a separate section. The alignment is then handled
  at link time by placing the section at a properly aligned location.
  
  Defect occurs in TMS470 Compiler versions: 5.1.0B1 - 5.1.4

Workaround:
  Place the symbol into a separate section. The alignment will apply to
  the section; the linker will place the section at the requested
  alignment. For example, the .align for func1 below
  may cause the bug, but the .align for func2 will work as expected.
  
      .text
      ...
      .align 32768 ; May trigger the bug
      func1:
      ...
  
      .sect ".text:func2"
      .align 32768 ; applied to section; assembler bug will not occur
      func2:
      ...
      .text ; switch back to .text section

3. Defects fixed in TMS470 Code Generation Tools release 5.1.4
===============================================================================

The following 8 defects were fixed in TMS470 Code Generation Tools release
5.1.4, released February 2014.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIXED SDSCM00045417
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary            : bool and _Bool are not defined correctly in strict ANSI
                     C mode

Fixed in           : 5.1.4
Severity           : S3 - Minor
Affected Component : C/C++ Compiler (cl)
Duplicate Defects  : SDSCM00048227, SDSCM00048226

Release Notes:
  The size and type of "bool" and "_Bool" must be the same in all modes
  so that declarations of the same object in different modules are
  compatible. However, in strict ANSI C89 mode, stdbool.h defines _Bool
  as "unsigned int," which means a C++ module using bool and a C module
  including stdbool.h and using bool are using incompatible types.
  
  _Bool and stdbool.h are C99 features, so a strictly-conforming C89
  program does not use them, but the TI compiler provides them as an
  extension. This would cause a problem when attempting to mix C++
  files and C files which both declare
  
  The ARM EABI Procedure Call Standard for the ARM Architecture (ARM IHI
  0042D) section 7.1.1 ("Arithmetic Types") requires that both C++ bool
  and C99 _Bool be unsigned byte types. However, the TI toolset does
  not conform to that requirement.
  
  Defect occurs in TMS470 Compiler versions: 4.4.0 - 4.4.18, 4.5.0B1 - 4.5.2,
  4.4.10.100 - 4.4.10.121, 4.6.0B1 - 4.6.6, 4.4.15.201 - 4.4.15.210, 4.7.0B1 -
  4.7.1, 4.8.0B1, 4.9.0B1 - 4.9.9, 4.7.1.201 - 4.7.1.202, 5.0.0B1 - 5.0.8,
  5.1.0B1 - 5.1.3

Workaround:
  The compiler and library now agree on a single definition of bool and
  _Bool in all modes; its format is equivalent to "unsigned char."
  Unfortunately, this represents a backward incompatibility with older
  object files which match all of these conditions:
  
  - C source code
  - includes stdbool.h
  - compiled in strict C89 mode (the default in older compilers)
  - module interface uses type _Bool or bool (i.e. a global variable,
    function argument, or function return value of type derived from
    bool, or struct containing a type derived from bool.)
  
  To work around the problem, either recompile with the latest version
  of the compiler, or ensure that you aren"t using any _Bool or bool
  objects in the module interface.

Summary            : Definition of SIZE_MAX is wrong

Fixed in           : 5.1.4
Severity           : S3 - Minor
Affected Component : C/C++ Compiler (cl)

Release Notes:
  The definition of SIZE_MAX was incorrectly specified as the largest
  signed integer value. It is now defined as the largest unsigned integer
  value.
  
  Defect occurs in TMS470 Compiler versions: 4.6.0B1 - 4.6.6, 4.9.0B1 - 4.9.9,
  5.0.0B1 - 5.0.7, 5.1.0B1 - 5.1.3

Workaround:
  None.

Summary            : Crash on object file with very long names, such as
                     mangled C++ templates

Fixed in           : 5.1.4
Severity           : S2 - Major
Affected Component : Disassembler (dis)

Release Notes:
  The disassembler prints symbols as labels when disassembling an object
  file. If any of those labels was longer than 256 characters, the
  label would overflow a buffer and cause memory corruption, possibly
  crashing the disassembler. Labels of that length are fairly common in
  C++ programs using templates.
  
  
  Defect occurs in TMS470 Compiler versions: 4.4.10.100 - 4.4.10.121,
  4.6.0B1 - 4.6.6, 4.4.15.200 - 4.4.15.210, 4.9.0B1 - 4.9.9, 5.0.0B1 -
  5.0.7, 5.1.0B1 - 5.1.3

Workaround:
  Use "armstrip" or "armstrip -p" to remove symbols from the file.

Summary            : #pragma CLINK does not work on initialized data

Fixed in           : 5.1.4
Severity           : S3 - Minor
Affected Component : C/C++ Compiler (cl)

Release Notes:
  The CLINK pragma now works as expected for initialized data.
  
  Defect occurs in TMS470 Compiler versions: 5.0.0B1 - 5.0.7, 5.1.0B1 - 5.1.3

Workaround:
  Only uninitialized data can be marked CLINK. To make data CLINK, make it
  unitialized and do the initialization at startup.

Fixed in           : 5.1.4
Severity           : S2 - Major
Affected Component : C/C++ Compiler (cl)

Release Notes:
  The compiler correctly handles const variables that are referenced in a
  program using templates.

Workaround:
  declare VAR as "extern const int VAR = 1;"

Summary            : The linker generates a relocation overflow for 
                     R_ARM_THM_ALU_PREL_11_0 when linking with IAR object
                     files.

Fixed in           : 5.1.4
Severity           : S2 - Major
Affected Component : ELF Linker

Release Notes:
  The current TI ARM tools do not use this relocation type. This bug
  occurs when interlinking with other ARM compilers; the IAR tools have
  been specifically found to use this relocation type. The error in the TI
  tools while handling this relocation type is now fixed.
  
  Defect occurs in TMS470 Compiler versions: 4.9.0 - 4.9.9, 5.0.0B1 - 5.0.8,

Summary            : Trampolines generated for symbols defined in the linker
                     command file cause a warning and are incorrect

Fixed in           : 5.1.4
Severity           : S1 - Critical / PS
Affected Component : Linker

Release Notes:
  When a called function beyond the reach of the call instruction, the
  linker uses trampolines to bounce control flow to the called function.
  In ELF, if the called function is an absolute symbol defined in the
  linker command file, the linker would create a trampoline that
  mistakenly bounced control flow to address 0 rather than the proper
  address of the called function.
  
  Defect occurs in TMS470 Compiler versions: 4.9.0B1 - 4.9.9, 5.0.0B1 - 5.0.8,
  5.1.0B1 - 5.1.3

Workaround:
  Disable trampolines with --trampolines=off or adjust the linker command
  file so that all calls to the function defined with an absolute symbol
  are in-range of the call instruction.

Fixed in           : 5.1.4
Severity           : S2 - Major
Affected Component : ELF Linker

Release Notes:
  The linker is incorrectly identifying the CIE version as 2 when it is
  really 3. The linker will now correctly identify the CIE version number.
  
  Defect occurs in TMS470 Compiler versions: 4.6.0B1 - 4.6.6, 4.9.0B1 - 4.9.9,
  5.0.0B1 - 5.0.8, 5.1.0B1 - 5.1.3

Workaround:

The following 13 defects were fixed in TMS470 Code Generation Tools release
5.1.3, released December 2013.

FIXED SDSCM00044118
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary            : Inline jump table mistakenly gets .clink attached

Fixed in           : 5.1.3
Severity           : S2 - Major
Affected Component : Code Generator

Release Notes:
  The compiler sometimes generates jump tables to implement switches.
  Usually, these jump tables are in a different section, and each
  section needs to be handled with the appropriate choice of .retain,
  .clink, or neither. In this case, as a special optimization, the jump
  table is actually part of the function text, and is not in its own
  distinct section. In this case, the compiler should not emit any
  .retain or .clink, but it emits .clink. The assembler detects this
  and (depending on the ABI) emits a warning that the .clink is ignored.
  
  Defect occurs in TMS470 Compiler versions: 4.7.0B1 - 4.7.1, 4.8.0B1, 4.9.0B1 -
  4.9.9, 4.7.1.201 - 4.7.1.202, 5.0.0B1 - 5.0.6, 5.1.0B1 - 5.1.2

Workaround:
  You can ignore this warning.

Summary            : Incorrect float compare when one value is equal to the
                     other but with all zero low word

Fixed in           : 5.1.3
Severity           : S2 - Major
Affected Component : Runtime Support Libraries (RTS)

Release Notes:
  The problem here is that the __aeabi_cdcmple function has a bug when comparing
  two float values that have identical upper 32 bits, but differ in the lower 32
  bits, and one of them has all 0's in the lower 32 bits. The last thing that
  happens in __aeabi_cdcmple is a comparison of the lower bits to 0, which sets
  the Z bit, which is incorrect - we want C=1 Z=0

Workaround:
  Use 32-bit float, or link against the RTS from another vendor's EABI
  toolchain.

Summary            : Errors of the linker due to the difference in version of
                     CGT

Severity           : S2 - Major
Affected Component : Linker
Duplicate Defects  : SDSCM00048621

Release Notes:
  The fix for SDSCM00044393 was intended to allow the following linker
  command file syntax:
  SECTIONS
  {
     OUTSECT_NAME  MEMORY_RANGE_NAME
  }
  
  The Assembly Language Tools User Guide erroneously stated that this
  syntax was accepted. However, allowing the above syntax introduces
  ambiguity in the linker command file grammar, which caused previously
  accepted command files to produce errors, resulting in this bug
  (SDSCM00048289).
  
  This change removes the fix applied for SDSCM00044393. The above syntax
  will no longer be accepted. The linker will now issue a warning if an
  output section is specified but no placement information is found for
  it. The documentation will be updated to specify that load allocation
  may be specified with the syntax "load = allocation" or "> allocation".
  
  The above syntax will result in a warning that no placement was specified
  for OUTSECT_NAME and a default placement will be applied. Valid linker
  command files that were rejected due to the ambiguity will now be accepted.

Workaround:
  The problem can be avoided by using memory range names that are different from
  section names. For example, this linker command file may cause the error
  because "RAM" is both a memory range name and a section name:
  
  MEMORY {
      RAM :
  }
  
  SECTIONS {
      <other section directives>
     RAM  : > RAM
  }
  
  But this one would not cause the error:
  
  MEMORY {
      RAM_MEM :
  }
  
  SECTIONS {
      <other section directives>
     RAM  : > RAM_MEM
  }
  
  Also okay:
  
  MEMORY {
      RAM :
  }
  
  SECTIONS {
      <other section directives>
     RAM_SECT  : > RAM
  }

Release Notes:
  The TI compiler will now set the PCS_config build attribute to value "1" aka
  "bare platform". It will accept tag values 0 (undefined) and 1 and mix them
  without a diagnostic message to ensure older object files can still be linked
  with newer files since this is a summary attribute and the critical checks
  occur on the attributes following it.

Release Notes:
  The problem is that the assembly instruction LDR r0,0x40004000 is not legal.
  The assembler believes 0x40004000 is a symbol because the user did not put a
  '#' in front of it. Adding the '#' produces the correct error: "Invalid

Release Notes:
  When using a weak symbol def with an initializer, the weak symbol could
  be pre-empted with a strong symbol from another compilation unit. The
  optimizer is not entitled to assume that weak definition is actually
  used, and thus cannot assume its initializer is the actual value it has
  at runtime. However, the optimizer mistakenly copied the value of the
  initializer into the function where the variable was used, which led to
  an error when the symbol was pre-empted by a strong symbol with a
  different value.

Summary            : asm470 crash on bad asm instruction

Fixed in           : 5.1.2
Severity           : S2 - Major
Affected Component : Assembler

Release Notes:
  The instruction in this test case (" MOV R0 #0") is missing a comma;
  the assembler discarded the #0 part as extra garbage, so the
  instruction looks like only one operand is provided. A function in
  the assembler which is checking whether the instruction can be a
  THUMB2 instruction, but doesn't check that the operand is non-NULL,
  leading to a NULL pointer dereference, which will crash the assembler.
  
  Defect occurs in TMS470 Compiler versions: 4.4.0 - 4.4.18, 4.5.0 - 4.5.2,
  4.4.10.100 - 4.4.10.120, 4.6.0B1 - 4.6.6, 4.4.15.200 - 4.4.15.210, 4.7.0B1 -

Workaround:
  Provide the correct number of operands to this kind of instruction,
  separated by commas where required. You can quickly find most of the
  errors in the instructions at issue by assembling in ARM mode, where
  the appropriate error messages will appear without the crash.

Release Notes:
  If all of --exceptions, --unused_section_elimination=off, and

Release Notes:
  There can be duplicate section names in an object file. When
  converting such a file, the hex converter will emit a warning and fail

Summary            : ELF section header table not guaranteed to be aligned

Fixed in           : 5.1.0
Severity           : S2 - Major
Affected Component : C/C++ Compiler (cl)

Release Notes:
  I conclude that the linker is generating something wrong when creating
  relocatable output that gets corrected when it later generates executable
  output. A further observation: after linking the relocatable linker
  output to form an executable, I note that the section headers are
  misaligned (at offset 0xaca from the start of the file).
  This appears to break the alignment rule from:
  http://www.sco.com/developers/gabi/2003-12-17/ch4.intro.html#file_format
  
  "All data structures that the object file format defines follow the
  ``natural'' size and alignment guidelines for the relevant class. If
  necessary, data structures contain explicit padding to ensure 8-byte
  alignment for 8-byte objects, 4-byte alignment for 4-byte objects, to
  force structure sizes to a multiple of 4 or 8, and so forth. Data also
  have suitable alignment from the beginning of the file. Thus, for
  example, a structure containing an Elf32_Addr member will be aligned on a
  4-byte boundary within the file. " Section headers contain Elf32_Addr
  members, and so should be aligned on a 4-byte boundary (which 0xaca
  isn't). It appears that the compiler is failing to pad the size of the
  string table to ensure the alignment of the following areas. You can see
  that the alignment of the section headers depends on the size of the
  string table by changing the function name to 'main2'. This generates an
  output file where the section header offset is 534. The misaligned
  section headers lead to a CCS crash (SDSCM00046176).

Fixed in           : 5.1.0B1
Severity           : S3 - Minor
Affected Component : Code Generator

Release Notes:
  The C++ type info is generated under EABI whenever the virtual function table
  is created as per the IA64 C++ ABI requirement. However, the typeinfo is not
  used if RTTI or C++ exceptions are not used. Hence it is a good candidate to
  place in slow external memory. However, they are presently generated under
  .const section and hence it is difficult to selectively group and place them.
  The proposal is to place the typeinfo under the .const:.typeinfo subsection to
  enable easier placement.
  
  For all targets except C2000's large data mode, typeinfo will now be placed in
  .const:.typeinfo, whereas C2000's large data mode will place it into
  .econst:.typeinfo. This behavior will be default in all future releases, but
  branch patches must provide the --typeinfo_subsections option in the shell to
  activate this placement change. This is because cache behavior could
  potentially be affected by changing the placement of the type information.
  
  To take advantage of this feature, the linker command file must detail the
  placement for the typeinfo subsection, most often times placing it into slow
  external memory to make room for more important data in faster memory.

  will be called even if symbol is weak and not defined.

Summary            : Linker fails with internal error: lnk6x failed to

Fixed in           : 5.1.0B1
Severity           : S2 - Major
Affected Component : Linker

Release Notes:
  The linker could report an internal error due to a memory allocation
  failure in certain cases. This bug involves the linker options
  --make_static, --localize, or --hide. If any of these options is used in
  a partial link, then the final link may produce the internal error. The
  linker was localizing comdat symbols during the partial link, which is
  incorrect behavior. The result was that the comdat symbols could not be
  resolved in the final link, but this was not detected properly, causing
  the memory allocation failure. One example of a comdat symbol is a
  static data member of a template class. The static data member must be
  resolved to a single instance, so it can not be localized during the
  partial link. This bug fix ensures that --make_static, --localize, and
  --hide do not affect comdat symbols during the partial link, and lists
  these symbols in the mapfile if requested. Also, if a similar symbol
  resolution error is encounted due to some other cause, the linker will
  now detect and report the error instead of encountering a memory
  allocation error later in the linking process.

Workaround:
  This bug can only be triggered if a partial link is performed using the
  --make_static, --localize or --hide option (the memory allocation
  failure will occur during the final link, however). Removing that option
  is one way to avoid this bug. Alternatively, the partial link step may
  be removed from the build process, if possible.

Fixed in           : 5.1.0B1
Severity           : S3 - Minor
Affected Component : C/C++ Compiler (cl)

Release Notes:
  The test case given assigned a integer to an enum scalar variable. MISRA
  checking correctly flags this with a diagnostic. The test case goes on to do
  the same thing with an enum array expression. It should get the same MISRA
  diagnostic, but does not. For example:
  
  typedef unsigned int uint16_t;
  
  uint16_t Func(void);
  
  typedef enum Error
  {
      OK,
      NO_DATA,

  const Error_t errors[2] = {OK, OK};
  
  uint16_t Func(void)
  {
      uint16_t myError;
  
      myError = OK; /* correctly flags as error (MISRA 10.1) */
  
      myError = errors[0]; /* does not find error */
  
      return myError;
  }

Fixed in           : 5.1.0B1
Severity           : S2 - Major
Affected Component : C/C++ Compiler (cl)

Release Notes:
  The problem could occur when an expression matches one of:
  x << a | y >> b if a + b = vsz
  x >> a | y << b if a + b = vsz
     x << z | y >> (vsz - z)
     x << (vsz - z) | y >> z
  
  Where:
  a and b are constant integers
  vsz is the size of x and y in bits
  
  When all of:
  x and y are expressions involving . or -> operators with the same left-hand
  sides
  x and y are of exactly the same type
  x and y are of unsigned type
  
  Effect of optimization:
  When compiler optimizer is enabled at -O1 or higher, the optimizer may
  transform equivalent code sequences into an expression which causes the
  problem to occur. For example, the sequence { int x = s.a, y = s.b; return x
  << 16 | y >> 16; } could still cause the problem despite the shift/or
  expression not directly including a . or -> operator. This includes sequences
  which may be generated as a result of function inlining.

Workaround:
  Workaround 1:
  Make sure x and y can't include structure references, for example by using
  a function such as the following to compute the expression:
  #pragma FUNC_CANNOT_INLINE(f); /* omit "(f)" in C++ */
  unsigned f(unsigned x, unsigned a, unsigned y, unsigned b) { return x << a
  | y >> b; }
  
  Workaround 2:
  Use volatile temporaries for x and y, for example:
  volatile int x = s.a;
  volatile int y = s.b;
  return x << 16 | y >> 16;

Affected Component : C/C++ Compiler (cl)

Release Notes:
  A sequence of code that initialises a struct by assignments to its fields,
  then copies the whole struct to another struct, then reads the fields
  individually, may sometimes read before the struct copy has happened. This
  situation has been observed when the initialisation is in an inlined function
  (and thus the struct-to-struct copy mimics the return from the callee), the
  struct read is defined within a scope that is not at top level, and another
  non-top-level scope defines a local array.

Workaround:
  No general workaround is known, aside from compiling with -o0 or -o1.. This
  specific case can be worked around by removing the extra braces around the
  bulk of the body of main(), or by inhibiting the inlining of GetPrms().

Fixed in           : 5.1.0B1
Severity           : S2 - Major
Affected Component : Optimizer

Release Notes:
  Certain intrinsic operations are commutative -- their operands can occur
  in either order. Many of these are parallel versions of common
  commutative operations, like _add2, or specialised versions, like _smpy.
  Minimum and maximum operations also have commutative intrinsics, _min2
  and _maxu4 for example.
  
  When one of these commutative intrinsics appears in a reduction -- an
  expression like
  
    x = _op(x, k);
  
  -- inside nested loops, the optimiser may crash. It is looking for
  similar kinds of expressions, but isn't handling intrinsics correctly.
  The compiler will either produce correct code here, or crash; it will
  not silently produce incorrect code.
  
  Some of these intrinsics can be introduced by the compiler itself, based
  on the original source code. The motivating case for this bug report
  looks like
  
    for (i = a;  i < b;  i++)
      for (j = c;  j < d;  j++)
      {
        t = ...;
        if (t < min) min = t;
      }
  
  and the compiler transformed the IF into _min2.
  
  For the problem to occur, the required ingredients are a commutative
  intrinsic or expressions that can be transformed into one, inside a nest
  of two loops that are simple enough that the outer loop may be unrolled.
  The workaround is to add "#pragma UNROLL(1)" to the outer loop, or to
  compile at -o1 or -o0, to prevent the transformation where the crash
  occurs.

Fixed in           : 5.1.0B1
Severity           : S2 - Major
Affected Component : Parser
Duplicate Defects  : SDSCM00043437

Release Notes:
  In EABI mode, static variables in template functions and static data
  members of template classes may not be properly allocated and/or
  initialized. Templates are typically defined in header files, resulting in
  separate instances in each translation unit (source file). The tools must
  merge these multiple instances into unique instances, and ensure that
  static objects are allocated and initialized only once. There are three
  specific cases in which these mechanisms may fail, resulting in incorrect
  behavior of the program. They are:
  
  1. A static variable in a template function, or a static variable in a member
     function of a template class, may not be allocated as a single unique
     object. This error occurs only when all of the following conditions occur:
     - the function is not declared inline, AND
     - the function is not implicity inline by virtue of having its body defined
       within the template class, AND
     - the function body is compiled in multiple translation units (i.e. the
       definition is in a header file).
  
  For example:
  
     template <class T>
     void f()
     { 
        static int var; 
        // ...
     }
  
  If this function definition is compiled into multiple translation units, the
  compiler may incorrectly create multiple instances of 'var'.
  
  Additionally, the compiler may incorrectly allocate 'var' into a section with
  other variables. This may cause unexpected behavior during linking, such as
  incorporating of unreferenced sections into the link, or changing the contents
  of the data section from link to link (depending on which copy of 'f()'
  arbitrarily gets linked in).
  
  A workaround for this defect is to declare the function f() as inline.
  
  2. Under the same conditions described in case 1, if the static variable is
     initialized with a constructor, the constructor may incorrectly be called
     multiple times.
  
  For example:
  
     template <class T> 
     void f() 
     {
        static T var;
        // ...
     }
  
  The constructor T::T() may be called multiple times to initialize 'var'.
  Declaring f() as inline also works around this problem.
  
  3. Similarly, if a static data member of a template class is initialized with
     a constructor, the constructor may incorrectly be called multiple times.
     This occurs only when all of the following conditions occur:
     - the definition (not the declaration) of the data member appears in
       multiple translation units, AND
     - the member is referenced in multiple translation units in which the
       definition occurs.
  
  For example:
  
     template <class T>
     class MyClass
     {
        static T var;     // declaration
     };
  
     // definition
     template <class T>
     T MyClass<T>::var; // may call T::T() multiple times
  
  A workaround for case 3 is to move the definition from a header file to a .cpp
  file, so that it only occurs once.

Workaround:
  1. If a template function, or member function of a template class, has a
     static varaible, declare the function 'inline'.
  2. If a template class has a static data member with initialization by
     constructor, put the definition of the data member in a .cpp file rather
     than a .h file.

Severity           : S3 - Minor
Affected Component : Code Generator

Release Notes:
  A constant expression of the form "0 / (-DBL_MIN / 2)" will cause the
  compiler to terminate with an internal error. In floating-point
  arithmetic, this is a well-formed expression. If denormal numbers are
  supported, the correct result is -0.0. Otherwise, the result is NaN,
  and the "invalid" floating point exception may be raised.

Affected Component : Parser

Release Notes:
  In EABI, due to the RTTI implementation, the compiler can only handle
  virtual base classes of a certain size. The parser incorrectly computed
  this size and did not emit a warning for very large virtual base classes
  that were too large. This would lead to data corruption.

Release Notes:
  Compiler generates Internal error: Constant table error

Workaround:
  There is an issue with the compiler pass that embeds constant definitions so
  that the references to these constants efficiently reach the definitions. The
  issue manifests when encountering large string constants that are placed close
  together in straight line code.
  
  A possible workaround is to try assigning pointers to the large string
  constants and use the pointers. For example:
  
  Instead of func(parm1,parm2, "A very long string constant ....")
  
  try:
  
  const char *sptr = "A very long string constant ...";
  :
  func(parm1,parm2,sptr);

Summary            : Fix to CQ44227 causes incompatible object code resulting
                     in link failure

Fixed in           : 5.1.0B1
Severity           : S2 - Major
Affected Component : ELF Linker

Release Notes:
  The fix to CQ44227 creates an object code incompatibility with object code
  from previous toolsets, which can cause a C++ program consisting of code from
  both to fail to link.
  
  CQ44227 was an issue with static data members of template classes and
  functions, which require an initialization guard variable to insure one-time
  initialization. The guard variable was introduced into the same COMDAT section
  as the static data member.
  
  The issue is that if code from an older toolset (which does not contain the
  guard) is linked with code from a newer toolset (which does), the linker may
  choose the COMDAT group without the guard, thus leaving no definition for the
  guard. This can trigger an undefined symbol error, or, if the object code is
  in a library, cause the linker to hang.
  
  This problem occurs only under the following conditions:
  - a static variable in a template function or static data member requires
    initialization by constructor (as described in CQ44227)
  - For C6x, the program includes object code compiled by version 7.3.6 of the
    C6x compiler, as well as object code compiled by an eariler version.
  - For ARM, the program includes object code compiled by version 4.9.6 or
    5.0.0, as well as object code compiled by an earlier version.

Workaround:
  None.

Summary            : EXIDX_CANTUNWIND yields invalid memory read

Fixed in           : 5.1.0B1
Severity           : S2 - Major
Affected Component : Runtime Support Libraries (RTS)

Release Notes:
  If an exception is thrown that tries to propagate up through any
  C-compiled function, the RTS must call std::terminate(). The linker
  is responsible for fabricating CANTUNWIND entries in the EXIDX table
  for C functions so that the unwinder knows it has unwound to a C
  function. If the C function happens to be placed after the last C++
  text section, the linker doesn't create such an EXIDX entry.
  
  This is a bug in the RTS. The EXIDX lookup does check whether it is
  running off the end of the EXIDX table, but when it does, it
  mistakenly attempts to read a value from just beyond the end of the
  table. This problem only occurs in EABI.

Workaround:
  This bug can only occur when the program is terminating due to a
  problem with an uncaught exception. To work around the issue, ensure
  that C++ functions which might be called from a C function catch all
  exceptions.

Release Notes:
  A simple loop nest that iterates over a two-dimensional array, or at
  least a data structure with two indexed parts (eg, x[i].y[j]), may
  compile incorrectly if the inner loop has a conditional break. The
  compiler converts the indexing into increments, with a correction amount
  at the end of the inner loop, and the early exit causes the converted
  code to misbehave. The listed workaround avoids the transformation and
  thus avoids the bug. The solution in the compiler is to recognise the
  early break and skip the transformation.

  the two accesses. Whether or not the result is correct is due to
  variations in the scheduling of instructions in the compiler output. The
  compiler misses the dependences because it doesn't properly sign-extend
  the unsigned difference computation and ends up with a large positive
  number instead of the correct small negative one.

Summary            : Workaround for Stellaris ARM cache silicon errata

Fixed in           : 5.1.0B1
Severity           : S2 - Major
Affected Component : Code Generator

Release Notes:
  Added a workaround for the silicon errata as described in the
  document "Stellaris LM4FS1AH5BB Rev A1/A2". This workaround is enabled
  through the --stellaris_cache_si_workaround compiler switch.
  
  If a word-aligned value is loaded from an SRAM location into a core
  register, then altered by storing a byte or halfword at an unaligned
  offset, the altered word-aligned value is not correctly indicated when
  loaded into a core register. The loaded value from the SRAM location into
  a core register will reflect the original value, not the modified value.
  The following assembly sequence causes the altered value loaded into a
  core register to not load the correct value, even though the correct
  value is visible in the SRAM memory location:
  
    LDR R0, [SP, #+0];
    STRB R0, [SP, #+1]; (STRH can cause silicon exception as well)
    LDR R0, [SP, #+0];
  
  This assembly sequence causes erroneous values only if these three
  instructions are executed in this order. However, the three instructions
  do not have to be consecutive, which means that other instructions can be
  placed in between the first and the second instructions or the second and
  the third instructions and the false value will still occur.
  
  The solution is to insert after the STR:
  
    STR V1, [SP, #-4];
    LDR V1, [SP, #-4];
  
  This forces the cached value to be reloaded from memory
  
  The compiler switch will add the necessary extra STR, LDR instruction
  to and from the stack. The --unaligned_access=on option cannot be used
  with the --stellaris_cache_si_workaround switch. If a user tries to do
  so, a warning will be emitted and unaligned accesses will be disabled.

Workaround:
  None.

Workaround:
  The test case is using memcpy() to implement a shift register in an
  array. More efficient, and also avoiding the problem, is to use a
  circular-queue arrangement: instead of having the head of the queue
  always be x[0] and implementing a pop by shifting the whole array, have
  the head be x[head] and implement the pop as head=(head+1)%arraysize.

Summary            : Multiplication by power-of-2 wider than int may use

Fixed in           : 5.1.0B1

Affected Component : Optimizer

Release Notes:
  When multiplying a variable of a type the same size as int, or smaller,
  by a constant power of two with a type wider than int, the compiler may
  convert the multiply into a shift-left, and use the wrong type, thus
  computing the wrong answer.

Release Notes:
  In some cases, the same code compiled with the same version of the
  compiler may produce different asm on Windows than on Linux. The reason

Fixed in           : 5.1.0B1
Severity           : S3 - Minor
Affected Component : C/C++ Compiler (cl)

Release Notes:
  The TI compiler supports only IEEE "round to even" mode. The compiler
  folds constant expressions using the FPSIM package. When rounding
  "exactly halfway" values, the constant folder rounded toward infinity
  rather than "round to even". This means that for some values, the
  value should be rounded *down* to the nearest even number, not up to
  an odd one. This is very unlikely to cause a problem for most
  programs; the symptom would be that the very last bit would be
  incorrect, which is a very, very small error.

Workaround:
  If maximum precision is required, avoid the use of constant float
  expressions; place each operand in a variable. The problem can also
  occur if the optimizer can determine the exact value of the operands.
  If using the optimizer, put at least one operand in a volatile

Duplicate Defects  : SDSCM00018364

Description:
  Users cannot create global accessible code with INLINE functions.
  The V3.00 compiler/code generator does not create globally accessible
  code for functions which are declared inline. A simple example is:
  
    inline int x() { return 1; }
    int y() {return 2;}
  
  When compiled with 'cl6x -k -c test.c', a warning is produced:
  
    'test.c', line 1: warning: function 'x' was declared but
    never referenced
  
  and the resulting assembler file (test.asm) does not
  contain any code for x(). The documentation states that code
  declared inline will be inlined in that module but global code will
  also be generated (section 2.10.3.2 in v3.00 C Compiler manual). The
  new compiler is overly aggressive in its optimizations. If y() is
  modified to call x() then code is generated for x() unless the
  optimizer is also invoked (by using -x2).

  "nelem" copies of "size" bytes, or NULL if the request cannot be satisfied.
  However, for some values of "nelem" and "size" (specifically when the result
  of nelem*size wraps around), calloc can return a pointer to an object that is
  not large enough, rather than NULL.
  
  For example, on a 32-bit target, if the user calls calloc(0x00010001,
  0x00010001), even though each argument by itself is reasonable, the request
  cannot be satisfied because the product is 0x000100020001, which exceeds
  size_t. (Note that we cannot check for overflow by checking if the product is
  less than either argument, which is commonly done for unsigned addition.)
  Arguably, we can try to claim that it is undefined behavior to make a call to
  calloc where the product would exceed size_t, but there doesn't seem to be
  anything in the standard which says so.
  
  The problem is worse on 16-bit targets, where calloc(0x0101, 0x0101) is enough
  to overflow size_t. It may not be obvious to the user that this overflows.
  
  Another concern is that it is hard to figure out whether a multiplication will
  overflow without having a double-width multiply available.

Summary            : Linker gives misleading warning when dot expressions
                     used in SECTION directive for .stack section
Affected Component : Linker

Description:
  Linker gives the warning:
  
  warning: creating ".stack" section with default size of 0x800; use the -stack
  option to change the default size
  
  even when the application does not link in boot code from RTS lib.
  
  A linker command file is used that contains a specialized SECTION directive
  for the ".stack" section. Because of a series of ". += <number>" assignments
  in the section spec, the linker is forced to increase the size of the .stack
  section to 0xc00. The linker is doing the correct thing by making a .stack
  section large enough to accommodate the dot expressions, but the diagnostic is
  misleading, as 0x800 isn't the final size of the .stack section.

  the value corresponds to its address in the file. In a partially linking
  object file, the sections will start at different addresses. The symbol values

Summary            : ARM RTS libraries expose enumerations across ABI

                     enumerations
Affected Component : Runtime Support Libraries (RTS)

Description:
  The ARM RTS libraries are marked as having no visible enumerations. This is
  true for the C library routines, but not the C++. Some C++ header files
  include inline functions that manipulate enumeration values. Possible
  solutions:
  
  1. Quit marking libraries as having no visible enums. This is bad because then
     we will have to provide libraries with both enum types.
  2. Get rid of the enumerations.
  3. Force enumerations exposed in header files to be either packed or int.
     Packed can be done using the packed gcc attribute. The trouble is that for
     ARM, gcc attributes are not available without the --gcc switch. I believe
     C6x exposes attributes by default, so we can probably make the switch for
     ARM (and maybe all targets). Forcing enums to be int can be done by
     including a dummy enumerator in every enumeration that is INT_MAX.

Summary            : Structure is not initialized correctly when using -o2 or

Affected Component : Optimizer

Description:
  There is a problem with the initialization of a structure using symbols
  generated in the linker command file. We use symbols generated in the linker
  cmd file using the dot operator. These symbols are used as an initial value
  for a class/struct with a constructor. In our case we want the difference of
  two addresses that the linker generates.
  
  When using optimization -o2 or -o3, the compiler generates .cinit entries
  instead of the constructor call. In those .init-entries it doesn't use the
  difference of the addresses; instead it uses the first symbol.
  
  When turning off optimization or using lower level of opt than -o2, the
  constructor calls are generated and the struct is initialized correctly.

Summary            : MISRA 12.8 and MISRA 10.5 false positives
Affected Component : Parser

Description:
  I was wondering if the compiler's MISRA checking is reporting false positives.
  I have the following code
  
  #define DEF_X (0x00000001UL)
  #define DEF_Y (4U)
  
  static void foo(void)
  
  {
  
      uint32 nReadData;
  
      nReadData = DEF_X << DEF_Y;
  
  }
  
  This gives me a MISRA error...
  
  #1397-D (MISRA-C:2004 10.5/R) If the bitwise operators ~ and << are applied to
  #an operand of underlying type unsigned char or unsigned short, the result
  #shall be immediately cast to the underlying type of the operand.
  
  But the underlying type is a "UL" or 32bit unsigned integer.
  
  If I try to fix the error using the code...
  
   nReadData = (uint32)DEF_X << DEF_Y;
  
  This gives me a MISRA error...
  
  #1407-D (MISRA-C:2004 12.8/R) The right-hand operand of a shift operator shall
  #lie between zero and one less than the width in bits of the underlying type
  #of the left-hand operand
  
  But the right hand operator has a value of 4 and the left hand operator
  is 32 bits.
  
  The only way I can solve the problem is by assigning the #define values to
  temporary variables and then doing the shift operation with these.
  
  With this in mind I think the misra checking is not handling the #define
  values correctly.. Am I correct in this assumption?

Summary            : Assembler mishandles certain combinations of S and
                     condition codes
Affected Component : Assembler

Description:
  The assembler mishandles the following UAL-syntax instructions:
  MOVSHI R2, R2, LSL #2
  MOVSLO R2, R2, LSL #2 ; actually CC
  MOVSHS R2, R2, LSL #2 ; actually CS
  LSLSHI R2, R2, #2
  LSLSLO R2, R2, #2 ; actually CC
  LSLSHS R2, R2, #2 ; actually CS
  
  These instructions have the status-setting flag S before the condition; this
  only affects the conditions HI, LO, and HS. Using the old style syntax (S
  after the condition code) works.
  
  Furthermore, the disassembler defaults to emitting the pre-UAL disassembly
  (SDSCM00046352).
  
  Always get the warning:
  
  "t.asm", WARNING! at line 3: [W0004] Invalid instruction modifier(s) ignored
  movslo r2,r2,lsl #2
  
  "t.asm", WARNING! at line 3: [W0004] Invalid instruction modifier(s) ignored

  lslslo r2,r2,#2
  
  "t.asm", WARNING! at line 4: [W0004] Invalid instruction modifier(s) ignored
  lslslo r2,r2,#2
  
  Changing to pre-UAL syntax: movlos r2,r2,lsl #2 works.

Summary            : Disassembler does not emit certain instructions in UAL
                     form by default
Affected Component : Disassembler (dis)

Description:
  See the test case for SDSCM00046351.
  For instructions combining the S flag and a condition code, UAL requires the S
  to appear before the condition code, but the disassembler puts it afterward,
  in the pre-UAL style:
  UAL syntax:
  LSLSEQ R2, R2, #2
  LSLSNE R2, R2, #2
  disassembler output: (7A8)
  MOVEQS R2, R2, LSL #2
  MOVNES R2, R2, LSL #2
  I've no idea whether UAL expects the LSL or MOV syntax.

Summary            : __ldrex pointer parameter should be "volatile void*"
Affected Component : C/C++ Compiler (cl)

Description:
  (This question was originally posted in the Stellaris area but Dave pointed
  out that it really belongs here)
  
  __ldrex and __strex intrinsics don't qualify parameter with volatile.
  
  According to ARM, the pointer parameter should be "volatile void*".
  http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0491c/CJA-
  FAFAF.html
  
  I have a variable which many source tasks race to change from zero to non-
  zero; this should use LL-SC. But only one sink task can change it when
  already non-zero. The sink task therefore doesn't need LL-SC, merely a
  volatile read and volatile write. However, the compiler won't let me mark the
  variable as volatile.
  
  These intrinsics should accept a pointer to volatile, because they access the
  location with volatile semantics, and the volatile qualifier can be implicitly
  added but not removed.
  
  
  volatile uint8_t active;
  
  do {
    if (__ldrexb(&active)) return;
  } while (__strexb(5, &active));
  
  
  Is there some reason that these instructions wouldn't behave as expected with
  volatile variables?

Summary            : Linker fails to warn when stack is not explicitly

Affected Component : Linker

Description:
  The linker command file for the attached test case does not allocate the
  .stack section to any memory range. It also uses the --warn_sections option.
  Thus, you would expect a diagnostic stating that .stack is being allocated
  without a SECTIONS specification. However, no diagnostic is issued.

Summary            : Compiler misreports Misra warning 10.1
Affected Component : Parser

Description:
  Compiler misreports MISRA warning 10.1/R for the following code.
  
  typedef enum _MyEnum { One, Two } MyEnum;
  MyEnum MyVariable;
  
  int foo(void)  
  {      
      int result = 1;        
      if (One == MyVariable)  // fails here with MISRA-C:2004 10.1/R      
      {          result = 2;      }          
      return result;  
  } 
  
  Our coding style convention requires that the variable is at the right hand
  side. Therefore I don't want to swap One and MyVariable, although that makes
  the warning to disappear.
  
  Is that a bug in the MISRA checker? If not, why is the comparison of two terms
  not commutable?

Summary            : The linker does not properly handle the Tag_nodefaults
                     build attribute
Affected Component : Linker

Description:
  The offending object file is generated by the ARM Ltd. compiler. The aeabi
  vendor section has a single file level attribute which is Tag_nodefaults and
  it is set to 1. It also has a set of attributes for the .emb_text section.
  
  The issue is that the linker is trying to read the Tag_ABI_align_preserved
  attribute from the file level attributes and since it does not exist, treating
  the value as 0 which means 4 byte alignment is preserved. This causes the
  error message. Because the Tag_nodefaults attribute is set to 1 the linker
  should not use 0 as the default value. The attribute should be treated like it
  doesn't exist and we should not try to enforce any kind of compatibility,
  similiar to if the aeabi vendor section didn't exist. We currently do not have
  the infrastructure to handle this.

  int _smsub(int src1 , int src2 );is actually defined by the compiler asint
  _smsub (shortsrc1, shortsrc2, inttmp); (int instead of short and missing 3rd
  parameter)
  
  All of the intrinsics need to be reviewed for possible mismatch.
